Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure.\n\nYour blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. For example, 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80.",

For most people who get this kind of blood pressure, it develops over time as you get older.\n- **Secondary** high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. It usually gets better after you treat that condition or stop taking the medicines that are causing it.\n\n### Why do I need to worry about high blood pressure?\n\nWhen your blood pressure stays high over time, it causes the heart to pump harder and work overtime, possibly leading to serious health problems such as [heart attack](https://medlineplus.gov/heartattack.html) , [stroke](https://medlineplus.gov/stroke.html) , [heart failure](https://medlineplus.gov/heartfailure.html) , and [kidney failure](https://medlineplus.gov/kidneyfailure.html) .",

It may include only the lifestyle changes. These changes, such as heart-healthy eating and exercise, can be very effective. But sometimes the changes do not control or lower your high blood pressure. Then you may need to take medicine. There are different types of blood pressure medicines. Some people need to take more than one type.\n\nIf your high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or medicine, treating that condition or stopping the medicine may lower your blood pressure.\n\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

Glucose is your body's main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but it also comes from the food you eat. Insulin is a [hormone](https://medlineplus.gov/hormones.html) made by your pancreas. Insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells, where it can be used for energy.\n\nIf you have diabetes, your body can't make insulin, can't use insulin as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. This can cause glucose levels to get too high. Over time, high blood glucose levels can lead to [serious health conditions](https://medlineplus.gov/diabetescomplications.html) . But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems.",

It happens when your [immune system](https://medlineplus.gov/immunesystemanddisorders.html) attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin.\n- [**Type 2 diabetes**](https://medlineplus.gov/diabetestype2.html) **.** This is the most common form of diabetes. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body may still be able to make insulin, but your cells don't respond well to insulin. They can't easily take up enough glucose from your blood.\n- [**Gestational diabetes**](https://medlineplus.gov/diabetesandpregnancy.html) **.** This is a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy.

This means that your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels. Beta blockers are typically used only as a backup option or if you also have certain other conditions.\n- **Calcium channel blockers** prevent calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows the blood vessels to relax.\n- **Diuretics** remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. This lowers the amount of fluid in your blood. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill.",
