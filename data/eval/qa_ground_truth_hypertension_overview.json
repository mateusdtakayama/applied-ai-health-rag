    "question": "What is blood pressure?",
    "ground_truth": "Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries and your blood pressure is highest at that moment, called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest between beats, your blood pressure falls, which is called diastolic pressure. A blood pressure reading uses these two numbers, for example 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80.",

    "question": "How is high blood pressure diagnosed?",
    "ground_truth": "High blood pressure usually has no symptoms, so the only way to find out if you have it is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider uses a gauge, a stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff, and will take two or more readings at separate appointments before making a diagnosis. For children and teens, the reading is compared to what is normal for other kids of the same age, height, and sex.",

    "question": "What are the categories of blood pressure in adults?",
    "ground_truth": "Blood pressure categories in adults are defined using systolic and diastolic numbers. Normal is less than 120 systolic and less than 80 diastolic. Elevated is 120–129 systolic and less than 80 diastolic. High blood pressure Stage 1 is 130–139 systolic or 80–89 diastolic. High blood pressure Stage 2 is 140 or higher systolic or 90 or higher diastolic. A hypertensive crisis is when blood pressure is higher than 180 systolic and higher than 120 diastolic and requires immediate medical care.",

    "question": "What are the main types of high blood pressure?",
    "ground_truth": "There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure. Primary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type and usually develops over time as you get older. Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or the use of certain medicines and usually gets better after you treat that condition or stop taking the medicines that are causing it.",

  {
    "question": "Why is high blood pressure dangerous?",
    "ground_truth": "When your blood pressure stays high over time, it makes the heart pump harder and work overtime. This can lead to serious health problems such as heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and kidney failure.",

  {
    "question": "What are the treatments for high blood pressure?",
    "ground_truth": "Treatments for high blood pressure include heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. You will work with your provider to come up with a treatment plan, which may include only lifestyle changes such as heart-healthy eating and exercise. These changes can be very effective, but if they do not control or lower your high blood pressure, you may need to take medicine. There are different types of blood pressure medicines, and some people need more than one type. If your high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or medicine, treating that condition or stopping the medicine may lower your blood pressure.",
