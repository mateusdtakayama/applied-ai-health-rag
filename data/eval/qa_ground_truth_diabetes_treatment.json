    "question": "What is diabetes?",
    "ground_truth": "Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a disease in which your blood glucose (blood sugar) levels are too high. Glucose is your body's main source of energy and comes from the food you eat as well as being produced by your body. Insulin, a hormone made by your pancreas, helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells, where it can be used for energy. In diabetes, your body can't make insulin, can't use insulin as well as it should, or both, so too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells.",

  {
    "question": "What are the main types of diabetes?",
    "ground_truth": "There are different types of diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, your body makes little or no insulin because your immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form; your body may still make insulin, but your cells don't respond well to it and can't easily take up enough glucose from your blood. Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy when your body can't make the extra insulin it needs.",

    "question": "What are the treatments for type 1 diabetes?",
    "ground_truth": "If you have type 1 diabetes, you will need to take daily doses of insulin, either by injection or through a special pump.
